## üîç Info

### ‚ö†Ô∏è FTLL IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
> This is an unfinished project, and although it is close to completion, we
recommend that you do not use it currently! Come back soon for more updates,
or visit our [website](https://ftl-launcher.com) for the latest.

FTLL is a simple and small mod launcher & manager for DayZ. Built with Rust,
[Tauri](https://tauri.app), React and modern tools. Completely open-source and
always will be. FTLL uses your systems native web-view to render a beautiful UI
letting us keep our bundle size extremely small. *Blazing* fast caching and loading
of the most popular servers in the DayZ community. Try it out today!

Although this project *was* built with Linux compatability in mind, I don't have
a Linux machine to test that, and disabling secure boot to dualboot Linux is a
non-starter. *Theoretically*, Tauri provides us with everything we need to push
a build out for Linux, but the difference in packaging amongst all the dozens
of distributions makes it a nightmare for a small developer.

### Features
- Playerlists for connected servers
- Accurate player counts
- *Blazing* fast Rust based server caching
- Intuitive UI
- Multithreaded server updating
- Open source
- And much more!

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Install
