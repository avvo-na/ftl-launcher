## Description
This project is still in development, and I am working on it in my free time. 
A lot of features are currently working, but theres a bit left to do. If you want
to catchup on the progress, you can visit the [project board](https://github.com/users/danlikestocode/projects/1).

> This project was built with Linux compatibility *in mind*, but it should be noted
that all of the development was done on Windows. I don't have a Linux machine
and turning off secure boot to dual boot Linux is a no-go for me. The dependencies
are cross-platform, and we don't bundle chromium, so it should be possible. Local
caching is done using browser API's. If anyone wants to contribute to Linux compatibility,
I would be more than happy to accept PR's.
