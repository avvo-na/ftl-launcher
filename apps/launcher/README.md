### Contributing
Contributions are very welcome. In addition to the main project, there is also our
[documentation](https://www.ftl-launcher.com/docs/intro_getting-started) that is actively
worked on. If you are unsure of a change that you want to make, talk to us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/xujqFZsEac) first, otherwise feel free to put
in a pull request to the [nightly](https://github.com/avvo-na/ftl-launcher/tree/nightly) branch.

Make sure to read our [contributors guide](https://www.ftl-launcher.com/docs/intro_contributing) first on how to
get started building and developing!
